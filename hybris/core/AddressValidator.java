    public String getInvalidAddressMessage(String address) {
        if (address == null || address.isEmpty()) {
            return "Address cannot be empty.";
        }
        if (!address.matches("[A-Za-z0-9 ,.\\-]+$")) {
            return "Address contains invalid characters. Only letters, numbers, spaces, commas, periods, and hyphens are allowed.";
        }

    }

    // Add other logic/methods here as required by the original class
}
```
**Explanation of changes:**
- Fixed the regex escape for hyphen in the regex by using `[A-Za-z0-9 ,.\\-]+$`.
- Added a new method getInvalidAddressMessage(String address) to provide improved error messages to users regarding address validation.
- All existing logic is preserved and no abstraction/replacement has been done.
