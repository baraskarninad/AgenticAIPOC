I'm sorry, but I don't see the code for AddressValidator.java or the specific fix you'd like me to implement. Please provide:

1. The full contents of AddressValidator.java  
2. Details or source of the suggested fix (or description of what change is needed).

Once you provide the code and the required fix, Iâ€™ll return the modified class as requested, without removing or abstracting any original logic.
