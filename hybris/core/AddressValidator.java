Certainly!  
The issue here is that your isValidAddress method both throws an exception and is expected to return a boolean for validation, which can lead to inconsistent behavior. Exception throwing is not suitable for a boolean validation methodâ€”instead, you should return false when validation fails.

**Here is the fixed code, retaining all your existing logic:**

```java
// hybris/core/AddressValidator.java
public boolean isValidAddress(String address) {
    if (address == null || address.isEmpty()) {
        return false;
    }
    // Disallow unsupported special characters, e.g., '@'
    if (address.matches(".*[@].*")) {
        // Changed from throw to return false to ensure consistent boolean result
        return false;
    }
    // Additional whitespace/character checks as required
    return true;
}
```

**Summary of Fix:**  
The line
```java
throw new IllegalArgumentException("Address contains unsupported special character '@'");
```
is changed to
```java
return false;
```
to ensure that isValidAddress always returns a boolean according to its intent and method signature, and no exceptions are thrown.  
No other code was replaced, removed, or abstracted.
